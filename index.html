            <img src="../assets/images/amy_headshotcopy.jpg" alt="My Image">
            <p1>I graduated from UCSB with a B.S. in Biopsychology and hope to exhance my neuroscience background with web developing skills through the Coding Bootcamp. I aspire to do research that involves creating neural simulations in order to better predict various pharmacological outcomes in the brain. I am particularly interested in mental disorders and abolishing the stigmas around them via scientific evidence.</p1>

            <p2>I enjoy exercising, being outdoors, and playing with my pup, Mika. It is the best when I can do all three simultaneously! I love hiking with her, as well as taking her to Dog Beach to run and swim together. She is my number one adventure buddy!</p2>
